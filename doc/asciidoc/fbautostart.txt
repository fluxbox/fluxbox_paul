NAME
----
fbautostart - Autostart all XDG applications

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbautostart* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbautostart(1)* is an XDG complaint startup tool. This will
go through the directories set up by the spec, and start all
applications that match it's current identifier. You may change
that identifier with the *--window-manager* flag.

This tool has almost no library dependencies and was written to be smart
about that sort of stuff. There is a greater then average chance
that you will find a bug, since it is a from-scratch implementation of the
.desktop spec. Pleas report bugs. Please.

FILES
-----
*~/.config/autostart*::
	This folder contains the default user XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden by an ENV variable )

*/etc/xdg*::
	This folder contains the default system XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden by an ENV variable )


OPTIONS
-------
*--noexec*::
	Do not execute any of the files,
	rather, display what would have been run

*--window-manager* ['WMNAME']::
	Override the compile-time default window
	manager, and work on behalf of this instead.
	This is helpful if you'd like to use this tool in
	place of another DE's normal XDG Autostarting
	application

*--license*::
	Show license information

*--version*::
	Show basic version information

*--help*::
	Show basic usage and flags

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

	The XDG root directory for the user's startup
	files, which may override the global startup files.

*XDG_CONFIG_DIRS*::
	The root XDG directory, where global XDG files are
	maintained.
