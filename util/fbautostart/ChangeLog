* Complete rewrite from scratch using a homebrewed stateful parsing model.
ak|ra was sure to note that `ragel' is the prefered solution, but I found out
that I actually hate `ragel' more then most things.
* The code has a few known bugs, but nothing fatal yet. This code is more stable
then the old fbautostart per-line parsing model.

* Fixed the license issue in the version and lecture
printouts. Still said GPL. Pfft!
* Moved the main method from fbautostart.cc to main.cc.
* Put fbautostart functions into the fbautostart namespace,
just in case we must use some of the XDG bindings from outside
of fbautostart it's self.

* Renamed the .cpp files to .cc, and .h files to .hh.
all source files affected.
* Licese change! Beware! License Change! We're now MIT
licensed.

* Removed the #define for the window manager setting in
include/fbautostart.h. It's now a const char, and dynamic
with the new --window-manager flag.
* Changed fbautostart to error out when you pass in a bum
flag. This caused me great pain the other day. Fixed now.
* Forgot to bump the version number. It's now version 2.71828.
Both of these changes were in src/fbautostart.cpp

* Bugfixes for random crap for XDG env issues.
This is a fix for issues that I missed when fixing
Segaja's issues.

* Bugfixes for random crap. Rewrote stuff to make
more sense.
* Fixed a few XDG spec issues. Should be betters now.
* Fixed a bug with env vars. Thanks, Segaja.

* Adding in the basic code stuff. Initial Release.
